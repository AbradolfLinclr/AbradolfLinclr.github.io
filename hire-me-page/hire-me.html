<h1> Looking for a developer?</h1>
<hr>
<p>Are you looking for a professional, communicative, and punctual entry level developer that is willing to go the extra yard to get some experience in the field?</p>

<p> Well fortunately for you, I am that guy. Some skills I have to offer are:
<ul>
  <li>Knowledge- I understand the value of knowledge. I love to learn and I have the ability to adapt quickly. </li>
  <li>Collaboration- There's no I in team, but there is me within a team. I enjoy getting multiple perspectives and branching on those around me.</li>
  <li>Communication- Communication is key. Anyone that has participated in any level of sports knows that nothing gets done according to plan unless we share and converse.</li>
  <li>Organization- I pride myself in my organizational skills (logs/folders/backups/etc). This also goes hand in hand with timekeeping.</li>
  <li>Attention to Detail- Did you see that? Because I definately did.</li>
  <li>Design- I have an appreciation and eye for good design. I can take a mockup to implementation.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am familiar with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML/CSS/Javascript</li>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>.Net</li>
    <li>Git/Github/Git Bash</li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some other weighing factors:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Insert resume here</li>
  </ul>

  <p></p?
