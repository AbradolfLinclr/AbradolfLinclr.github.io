<p>I am an entry level web & software developer from San Diego, California. I primarily use HTML/CSS/Javascript and Java. I began coding earlier this year in January and am following the freeCodeCamp map towards my goal of being a full stack developer. I find comfort in the creative, critical thinking solutions coding provides. The number one reason why I love to code is that nothing is out of reach. Want to add a new feature or learn a new library? Everything is just a google search away. Not only do I get to learn something new but I also have the chance to save someone else's time, so they may enjoy what they love to do.

 Not only do I enjoy it but I also enjoy the team aspect as well.  I found the coding community very comfortable and welcoming.  From what I've gathered working in the service industry for so many years, it takes time for people to warm up to others and give them a helping hand. What I gathered in a couple months of coding, everyone does their part to help out the community. My highschool soccer coach always said, "No one can whistle a symphony. It takes a whole orchestra to play it." This concept is understood very well in the coding community.</p>

<p>We are creative, critical thinking problem solvers. Nothing is out of arm's reach; this is the second reason I love to code. Everything is a google search away. Want to add a feature? Don't sweat it, give me an hour or two and I'll figure it out. I get to learn a new tool and those couple hours will save someone else's valuable time. They now have more time to do what they love to do. It is the unconditional self-rewarding tasks that keep me going, and the feeling of self-accomplishment that makes coding my passion.  </p>

<p>As much as I love reading through my code to find out I mispelled an object by a single uppercase letter, I do enjoy any excuse to get out of the house. This usually involves hanging with the close knit group of friends I share, some boxing, a little yoga, and the occasional watering hole. Well enough about me, check out my <a href = "../projects-page/projects.html">Projects Page</a> to get a better grasp of the work I do or maybe just skip to the <a href = "..\hire-me-page\hire-me.html">Hire Me</a> page and get the show on the road. Either way, thank you for taking the time out of your day to check out my website!</p>
